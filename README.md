This is the **first** released version of the Brute Force Gimkit Joiner. 
Give any feedback on how my script could be improved please!

Download the script here:
[BruteForceGimkitV1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23748673/BruteForceGimkitV1.py)

**Change the paths inside of the script to match the location of your images! If you don't do this step, the script won't work!**

If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use .pyw instead of the standard .py to ensure the window won't interrupt the script. If you're on Linux, use PyInstaller or a Linux-specific packaging tool (like creating a .deb package) to prevent the window from appearing. Or if you're on MacOS, use PyInstaller with the --windowed flag to create a standard .app bundle.

**If the script doesn't stop running, move your cursor to the bottom left to forcefully stop it.**

**This script works best during school hours.**

_Read the description below for setting up the script and its modules._


## Installation of Python and Modules 
Be sure to have Python installed onto your device, if not, download it from their official website:
_https://www.python.org/downloads/_

Be sure to have these following external modules installed for Python:
- _Pyautogui_
- _Pillow_
- _OpenCV-Python_
- _Pathlib_

If you don't have those modules, input these lines into your terminal:

Windows (Recommended Method):
- _python -m pip install pyautogui_
- _python -m pip install pillow_
- _python -m pip install opencv-python_
-  _python -m pip install pathlib_

Linux/MacOS (Recommended Method):
- _python3 -m pip install pyautogui_
- _python3 -m pip install pillow_
- _python3 -m pip install opencv-python_
-  _python3 -m pip install pathlib_


## Setting Up the Script
You will need to contain these 3 images for the script to function correctly; you can contain them here or screenshot them in the Gimkit Join screen—**png images are recommended**:

<img width="167" height="38" alt="GameCode" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7220962-f6c8-4937-8635-2e83768061be" />

<img width="500" height="64" alt="Join" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1761bd7d-0bc8-4af8-baf5-438c1b383c0a" />
<img width="162" height="44" alt="YourName" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d3df300-d33c-42d5-8f01-9d2e52a2bf19" />


If you chose to take screenshots, crop them similarly to the images above:
 _https://www.gimkit.com/join_

To contain the "YourName" image, you have to join a Gimkit game and be at the name prompt; the easiest method is by creating your own game and then joining it as another player.

This is an **optional** step: you can rename the images to match the names in the script, if else, adjust the names inside of the script to match yours:

-  _Join.png_

-  _GameCode.png_

-  _YourName.png_

This is another **optional** step: you can place all of the images inside of a folder to stay organized; you can match the folder name inside the script or change it to match yours:
- _Python_Images_

Now download the script:
[BruteForceGimkitV1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23748673/BruteForceGimkitV1.py)

If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use _.pyw_ instead of the standard _.py_ to ensure the window won't interrupt the script. If you're on Linux, use PyInstaller or a Linux-specific packaging tool (like creating a .deb package) to prevent the window from appearing. Or if you're on MacOS, use PyInstaller with the _--windowed_ flag to create a standard _.app_ bundle.


## **_!!IMPORTANT STEPS!!_**
**Change the paths inside of the script to match the location of your images! If you don't do this step, the script won't work!**

Finally, go to the Gimkit Join screen and run the script—everything should work according to plan:
