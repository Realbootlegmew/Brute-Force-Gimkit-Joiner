Give any feedback on how my script could be improved please!

Bug Fixes:
- _The script now stops itself properly upon reaching the name prompt._

Changed/New Features:
- _Added miss counter before the script stops itself, can be adjusted to your liking_
- _Removed the required use of YourName.png_

Download the script here:
[BruteForceGimkitV2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23760551/BruteForceGimkitV2.py)


**Change the paths inside of the script to match the location of your images! If you don't do this step, the script won't work!**

**This script works best during school hours.**

_Read the description below for setting up the script and its modules._


## Installation of Python and Modules 
Be sure to have Python installed onto your device, if not, download it from their official website:
_https://www.python.org/downloads/_

Be sure to have these following external modules installed for Python:
- _Pyautogui_
- _Pillow_
- _OpenCV-Python_
- _Pathlib_

If you don't have those modules, input these lines into your terminal:

Windows (Recommended Method):
- _python -m pip install pyautogui_
- _python -m pip install pillow_
- _python -m pip install opencv-python_
-  _python -m pip install pathlib_

Linux/MacOS (Recommended Method):
- _python3 -m pip install pyautogui_
- _python3 -m pip install pillow_
- _python3 -m pip install opencv-python_
-  _python3 -m pip install pathlib_


## Setting Up the Script
You will need to contain these 2 images for the script to function correctly; you can contain them here or screenshot them in the Gimkit Join screen—**png images are recommended**:
<img width="167" height="38" alt="GameCode" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7220962-f6c8-4937-8635-2e83768061be" />
<img width="500" height="64" alt="Join" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1761bd7d-0bc8-4af8-baf5-438c1b383c0a" />

[Python_Images.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23760637/Python_Images.zip)

If you chose to take screenshots, crop them similarly to the images above:
 _https://www.gimkit.com/join_

This is an **optional** step: you can rename the images to match the names in the script, if else, adjust the names inside of the script to match yours:

-  _Join.png_

-  _GameCode.png_


This is another **optional** step: you can place all of the images inside of a folder to stay organized; you can match the folder name inside the script or change it to match yours:
- _Python_Images_

Now download the script:
[BruteForceGimkitV2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23760551/BruteForceGimkitV2.py)


## **_!!IMPORTANT STEPS!!_**
**Change the paths inside of the script to match the location of your images! If you don't do this step, the script won't work!**

Finally, go to the Gimkit Join screen and run the script—everything should work according to plan:
